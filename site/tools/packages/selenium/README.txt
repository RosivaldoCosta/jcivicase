This is my setup from Ubuntu

./selenium is used to start and stop the server in headless mode

usage: 
selenium start
or
selenium stop

Selenium server runs on port 4444 by default,
you may change it by the parameter -port


Basically,
to start the server you just need to run:

java -jar selenium-server.jar
from the command line.
The terminal window must stay open as long as the Selenium tests are running.
