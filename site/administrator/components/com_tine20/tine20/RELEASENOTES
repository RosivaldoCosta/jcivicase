--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Tinebase_Controller_Record_Abstract: new/renamed inspection functions (API)

- We have renamed the _inspectUpdate() /_inspectCreate() functions to _inspectBeforeUpdate() / _inspectBeforeCreate().
- Added new functions _inspectAfterUpdate() / _inspectAfterCreate().

--------------------------------------------------------------
2. Switched from Zend_Date to DateTime

- We switched from Zend_Date to php DateTime to improve the performance of datetime handling. 

--------------------------------------------------------------
3. Added new log level: TRACE

- A new log level has been added: TRACE (8). It logs even more verbose than DEBUG (7). You can activate it in your config.inc.php:

    'priority' => '8',

--------------------------------------------------------------
4. Added action-queue
    
- Some jobs (for example the calendar notifications) can be processed by an action-queue.

- To activate the (db) queue, you need to add the following to your config.inc.php file:

  'actionqueue' => array(
    'adapter' => 'Db',
    'driverOptions' => array (
        'host' => 'localhost',
        'dbname' => 'queue',
        'username' => 'user',
        'password' => 'pw',
        'type' => 'pdo_mysql',
    ),
  ),

- If you use the db-adapter, it is necessary to create the queue and message tables first. use the queue.sql script found in the [tine20dir]/library/Zend/Queue/Adapter/Db directory.

- The queue is triggered by the processQueue CLI function.

--------------------------------------------------------------
5. User contact / group list records can now be saved in other Addressbooks

- In older versions, there has been only one internal Addressbook where all user contact/group list records were saved in. In Neele, you can choose in which Addressbook a contact/list 
is saved in. 

- A new config for default internal Addressbook has been added. Change it in Admin/Applications/Admin/Settings.

--------------------------------------------------------------
6. Customfields are now sorted by order column

- Please check the order of your customfields: they used to be sorted by name and are now sorted by the order column.

--------------------------------------------------------------
7. Session directory config has moved and other session backends are possible now

- The session options (like sessiondir and lifetime) can be configured this way now (deprecated settings will show a warning in the logfile):

  'session' => 
  array (
    'backend'   => 'File',
    'path'      => '/tmp/tinesessiondir',
    'lifetime'  => 86400,
  ),

- you can add a redis session backend like this:

  'session' => 
  array (
    'backend'   => 'Redis',
    'host'      => 'localhost',
    'port'      => 6379,
    'lifetime'  => 86400,
  ),

--------------------------------------------------------------
8. New right has been added to Tinebase: Manage state

- With this right, you can control if the state of grids and other stateful widgets is saved for certain user roles.

--------------------------------------------------------------
9. Sieve rules/vacation support

- We added support for Sieve filter rules and vacation messages. To activate this for the system email account, you need to add the Sieve server settings in the setup.php/Email Settings.
For other email accounts, you just need to add the settings in the email account edit dialog. The IMAP credentials are used to authenticate with the Sieve server.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------
10. Added clear cache job to scheduler

- A cache clearing job has been added to the scheduler. It runs every hour and removes obsolete cache entries.

--------------------------------------------------------------
11. New config.inc.php value: 'filesdir'

- We added a new value to the config.inc.php: 'filesdir'. This is needed for the WebDav implementation and defines the directory on your server where files are saved in. Make sure that 
the webserver has write permissions for this directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------
12. Added new email user backends

- The email user administration now supports the Cyrus mailserver, Postfix and Dovecot MySQL. You can set it up in the setup.php script.

--------------------------------------------------------------
13. IMAP authentication provider

- We added the possibility to authenticate against an IMAP server. You can set it up in the setup.php script.

--------------------------------------------------------------
14. Added switch --passwordfile to CLI

- It is now possible to call the CLI-script with a --passwordfile parameter to define a file with the password for the user.

--------------------------------------------------------------
15. New CLI functions

- Some new CLI functions have been added in this release (see the wiki page http://www.tine20.org/wiki/index.php/CLI_Functions for a full list and documentation):
    - Tinebase.processQueue
    - _Application_.import
    - Tinebase.clearTable
    - Tinebase.purgeDeletedRecords
    - Tinebase.addCustomfield 

--------------------------------------------------------------    
16. Voipmanager and Phone applications have been moved to separate package

- These two applications have been moved to a separate package that can be downloaded on the Tine 2.0 Download page.
