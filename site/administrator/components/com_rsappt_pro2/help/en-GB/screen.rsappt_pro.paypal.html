<h1>PayPal</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p><em>Your customers do not need a PayPal account to purchase with PayPal. </em></p>
<p>Appointment Booking Pro 1.4 can be set to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Not use PayPal</strong> - no PayPal payment is invoked.</li>
  <li><strong>Only use PayPal</strong> - the user can <strong>only</strong> make a booking if they pay.</li>
  <li><strong>Offer both PayPal and non-PayPal</strong> - you can give the user the choice, two buttons one for PayPal, one for no-PayPal (pay later)</li>
</ul>
<p>With PayPal enabled, the booking screen will show the calculated  cost at hours x rate, or flat rate depending on how you set it up. </p>
<p>The other main difference when enabling PayPal, is that a new  request will get inserted with a status of 'pending' rather than 'new'.  The user is sent to PayPal to make their payment. They are sent back to  your site. In a separate thread, PayPal processes the payment and sends  an IPN (Instant Payment Notification) message to your site. This IPN is  really not 'instant' and your customer may have been returned to your  site before the IPN arrives. In this case the in-progress message is  shown to the customer. When PayPal completes the payment processing,  they send the customer an email and send your site an IPN message. When  the customer comes back to your site, the return page checks to see if  the transaction has completed. If it has it displays the confirmation  message, if not it displays the in-progress message. These messages are  set in the 'Messages' tab. </p>
<p>There is a possibility that the customer may abandon the booking  after being sent to PayPal. In this case the booking will stay in  'pending' and need to be cleared manually. If the customer elects to  'Cancel' the payment in PayPal, the IPN will reflect that and ABPro  will set the request from 'pending' to 'canceled'.</p>
<hr />
<p>The relation between ABPro's <em>'Auto-Accept</em>' and <em>'PayPal Enabled'</em> is show below.</p>
<p><strong>PayPal = No</strong> (no PayPal submit button)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <strong>Auto-Accept = Yes</strong><br />
    New booking status = 'Accepted' (timeslot locked)<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Auto-Accept = No</strong><br />
    New booking status = 'New' (timeslot not locked)<br />
  </p>
  <p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PayPal = Yes</strong> (ONLY PayPal submit button shown)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <strong>Auto-Accept = Yes</strong><br />
    New booking status = 'Pending' -&gt; goes to 'Accepted' on IPN ok  (Pending locks appointment)<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Auto-Accept = No</strong><br />
    New booking status = 'New'<br />
    Accept on Payment = Yes -&gt; goes to 'Accepted' on IPN ok</p>
  <p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PayPal = Optional</strong> (both submit buttons shown)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> <u>non-PayPal Submit</u><br />
      <strong>Auto-Accept = Yes</strong><br />
    New booking status = 'Accepted'<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Auto-Accept = No</strong><br />
    New booking status = 'New'</p>
  <p> <u>PayPal Submit</u><br />
      <strong>Auto-Accept = Yes</strong><br />
    New booking status = 'Pending' -&gt; goes to 'Accepted' on IPN ok        (Pending locks appointment)</p>
  <p><strong>Auto-Accept = No</strong><br />
    New booking status = 'New'<br />
    Accept on Payment = Yes -&gt; goes to 'Accepted' on IPN ok</p>
  <p> </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Important!!</strong></em></p>
<p>When a booking is made with status 'Pending', the timeslot is locked  just as if it were accepted. The display GAD display will show a dashed  border so you can see what timeslots are 'Pending'. Normally a slot  should only be 'Pending' for a few minute (seconds?) while PayPal is  processing the payment. If the user aborts out of PayPal without  paying, the slot will stay 'Pending' (and locked) until admin deletes  it.</p>
